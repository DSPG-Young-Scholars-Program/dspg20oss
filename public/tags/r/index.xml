Top Continents Where GitHub Users are Located North America is the continent with the highest number of GitHub users - followed by Europe and Asia.</description>

      <description>/* this chunk of code centers all of the headings */ h1, h2, h3 { text-align: center; }  Data &amp;amp; Methods One of the main goals of our summer project is to understand who is producting open-source software (OSS) and important characteristics about them, including which sectors they are embedded within. To classify contributors into the academic sector, we matched GitHub users&#39; email and self-reported affiliation columns to information about universities and colleges from around the world using the Hipo Labs&#39; university domain list - a dataset that has names, countries, and domain names for nearly 9,800 universities across the world.</description>
