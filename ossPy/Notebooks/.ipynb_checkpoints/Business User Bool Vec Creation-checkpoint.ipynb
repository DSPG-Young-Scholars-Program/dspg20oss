    "As part of our overarching strategy for assigning users to specific sectors, we need to be able to assign users to business as well.  Given the specifics of our source dataset (GHTorrent), we can reasonably assume that the more frequently that a company name appears, the more \"authoratative\" (reflective of a consensus) of a representation of that company name it is.  Once we've removed the user entries that correspond to the non-business sectors, we can be reasonably confident in mapping users whose worplace affiliation listing is shared with some critical threshold of other users (i.e. 5) to the business sector.\n",
