      <description>While this page is optional, it probably makes sense to have one weighted at the top (see the front matter at the top of this Rmd file) that gives a general overview of the project. This could be something like the final poster while the other pages highlight more in-depth observations. Here is a general schema of what should be covered throughout your website:

      <description>We conducted analysis on GitHub users&#39; geographic location, which was scraped from their public user profile. While 77.23% geographic information (country and city name) were missing, we were still able to map 488104 GitHub users in our final analyses.
Top Continents Where GitHub Users are Located North America is the continent with the highest number of GitHub users - followed by Europe and Asia.</description>

      <description>One of the main goals of our summer project is to understand who is producting open-source software (OSS) and important characteristics about them, including which sectors they are embedded within. This page focuses on the approach we took to classifying GitHub users into the academic sector as well as the prodcedures that we took to finding out which institutions they are affiliated.
First, cleaning hipolabs data before comparing it with github users.</description>

It ends up being a little tricky, but as long as you have created a folder to insert your images, you can just use some markdown code or html to insert images in the format you want.</description>
